CRUD operations demonstrations as a blogging app. Editing blogs through frontend a work in progress. Deleting, creating, and getting posts work fine. Recent changes include renaming of some classes and id's, removing of shopping list and recipes api's. 
update: After some merging errors, files in folders PUBLIC and VIEWS had to be fixed. CRUD operations still work, but css styling is not working yet.
